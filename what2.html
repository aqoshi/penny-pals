            <h1>Lesson #2: Debit/Credit Cards</h1>
            <br>
            <h2>Debit Cards</h2>
            <p> 
                Imagine your debit card is like a super convenient wallet that's connected to your piggy bank at home. When you buy something using a debit card, it's like taking money straight from your piggy bank to pay for it. The cool part is that you can use this card to buy things in stores or online, just like magic! But remember, the money for the things you buy comes from your own saved-up money in your piggy bank or your bank account.
            </p>
            <h2>Credit Cards</h2>
            <p>
                Now, think of a credit card like a special loan card that lets you borrow some money from a friendly bank whenever you want to buy something. When you use a credit card to get something, you're borrowing money from the bank. But you have to promise to pay back what you borrowed later, usually at the end of the month. If you don't return the borrowed money on time, the bank might ask for a bit more (called interest), which means you pay extra for borrowing.
            </p>
            <h2>Difference Between Debit and Credit Cards</h2>
            <p>
                So, the big difference is that a debit card uses your own money from your piggy bank or bank account, and a credit card lets you borrow money from the bank that you need to pay back later. With a debit card, you're spending your own money, and with a credit card, you're using someone else's money and promising to pay it back.
